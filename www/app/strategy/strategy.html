                -Go for the Exo Suit first. Its one hit kill till round 5. So whats you have it, start punching to get a gun.
                <br>
                <br>-Don't by the door right next to Exo Medic going into Decenimation room. It Will be very usful in Host rounds when the zombies can only go one direction and not come behide you.
                <br>
                <br>-Train outside, theres open space so it wont be that easy to get traped.
                <br>
                <br>-If its to crowded outside, go to the main hub into the holding room. Turn on the the security trap in the hallway. Then go into the Exo Testing room. Turn on the trap in that room. Once its to crowded in the Exo Room. Go into the trash chute back outside.
                <br>
                <br>-Buy the Exo Upgrade in this order because if you go down. You have a good chance of not losing the most important perks.
                <br>^First Get Exo Health. One its the most expensive perk out of them all and second you really need it in the high rounds or any round to survive longer
                <br>^Second Perk is Exo Reload. Its better to reload quickly then slowly.
                <br>^third Perk is Exo Soldier. Its good to reload and sprint expecially when you have big hordes of zombies and better hip fire accuracy.
                <br>^Fourth Perk is Exo Slam. Good to have an extra weapon that doesnt require ammo.
                <br>^Fifth Perk is Exo Medic. This Perk is the cheapest one. So its not that hard to get the credits back when you loose them.
                <br>The Exo Medic Perk is first if playing solo.

                -Training around the Burger Town is easy sometimes.
                <br>
                <br>-When A Goliath comes use a trap like a mortar strike because its easier to kill that way.
                <br>
                <br>-When a Survivor comes along try using the abulance or the destraction drones so its easier to rescue him.
