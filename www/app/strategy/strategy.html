                -Go for the Exo Suit first. It's one hit kill till round 5. So once you have it, start punching to get a gun.
                <br>
                <br>-Don't buy the door right next to Exo Medic going into Decontamination room. It will be very useful in infection rounds when the zombies can only go one direction and not come be hide you.
                <br>
                <br>-Train outside, there's open space so it won't be that easy to get trapped.
                <br>
                <br>-If it's too crowded outside, go to the main hub into the holding room. Turn on the the security trap in the hallway. Then go into the Exo Testing room. Turn on the trap in that room. Once it's too crowded in the Exo Room. Go into the trash chute back outside.
                <br>
                <br>-Buy the Exo Upgrade in this order because if you go down. You have a good chance of not losing the most important perks.
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Exo Health. One it's the most expensive perk out of them all and second you really need it in the high rounds or any round to survive longer</li>
                    <li>Exo Reload. It's better to reload quickly then slowly.</li>
                    <li>Exo Soldier. It's good to reload and sprint especially when you have big hordes of zombies and better hip fire accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Exo Slam. Good to have an extra weapon that doesn't require ammo.</li>
                    <li>Exo Medic. This Perk is the cheapest one. So it's not that hard to get the credits back when you lose them.</li>
                </ol>
                    The Exo Medic Perk is first if playing solo.

                -Training around the Burger Town is easy sometimes.
                <br>
                <br>-When A Goliath comes use a trap like a mortar strike because it's easier to kill that way.
                <br>
                <br>-When a Survivor comes along try using the ambulance or the distraction drones so its easier to rescue him.
