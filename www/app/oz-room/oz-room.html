    <div class="description">

        Oz's room is a room-like-arena. You spawn here on rounds 5, 13 and 20.
        <br> <br>
        <div class="Round">
            Round 5
        </div>
         On round 5 Oz will teleport you to the room. He will kind of show you what the traps look like as well as for you to look around and see where everything is.
        <br> <br>
        <div class="Round">
            Round 13
        </div>
         On round 13 you will have to destroy 4 control panels that Oz is in. Every side of the room there is a room where Oz can be. In order to shoot Oz in the room a door will have to open.
        <br> <br>
        <div class="Underline">
            Opening the Doors
        </div>
         To open a door you will have to complete the traps that Oz will control.
        <br>
        <br> The traps are:
        <br>
        <br> - Electric floor-This will be on the floor. So when you see sparks, get on the higher deck or you will die if you stay on too long. Some areas the floor will not be electrified.
        <br> - Lasers-Do not Exo jump. If you do they will be shut down because of the lasers that will be above you. They're red lasers.
        <br> - Infected Zone-The 4 pillars will be infected. There will be a gas coming down on to the pillars. Just like the Host zombie's gas that comes out of them.
        <br> The door can open even though a trap is still on. Only one trap happens at a time.
        <br>
        <br> When you first try to destroy the first Control panel there will be no traps. The second time there will be one trap then the door will open and so on and so on until you have destroyed all 4 control panels.
        <br>
        <br> While these traps are on, any type of zombies can spawn and atlas turrents will spawn to. You do not get points for killing zombies. The turrents can be above you or on ground level. Just look for a red laser that's moving around and destroy it (they can get really annoying).
        <br>
        <br> After a while the traps will turn off and the door will open (a noise of the door opening can be heard). When the door has open, shoot Oz until an explosion occurs. This indicates that the room is shut down. Recommend the Trident or Blunderbuss when trying to shoot him. Also any type of grenade will do. The door will close in a certain amount of time. If it closes, you will have to do another trap and once that's finish the door will open again.
        <br> <br>
        <div class="Underline">
            In The Room
        </div>
         There is a 3D Printer, Upgrade Station, Decontamination Zone, Contact Grenades and Ammo Supply Drops (one at a time) in the room.
        <br> <br>
        <div class="Underline">
            Destroying all 4 control panels
        </div>
         Wants you have destroyed all off them. A DNA bomb will be dropped and also a max reload. Credit Supply drops will be dropping when you have finished. There is a time limit so get them as fast has you can (An-G will start to count down). Whenever the time limit is done, you will teleport back to the location you were before.
        <br> <br>
        <div class="Round">
        Round 20
        </div>
        On round 20, you will have to kill Oz.
        <br> <br>
            <div class="Underline">
        Zombie Oz
            </div>
        Oz is really big this time. One arm is bigger than the other (the bigger arm is what he hits you with). He shoots EMP rockets at every player that's in the game. When shot your exo suit will go down for a few seconds. When he hits you, you will be infected until you use the Decontamination Zone.
        <br> <br>
        <div class="Underline">
                Oz's Health and killing him
                </div>
        Oz has a shield which makes it where you can't kill him. To take his shield down you have to turn on 4 power generators to activate the Decontamination Zone. The Decontamination Zone is what takes his shield down. When his shields are down, he will stay still for a few seconds. During this time you want to shoot Oz. The Blunderbuss does a lot of damage to him especially when upgraded. Every time his health goes down 25%, he will disappear and you will have to kill all the zombies that spawn in.
        <br> <br>
        Different things happen, in order, when you get his health down every 25%.
        <br>
        -First 25% you have to kill Oz.
        <br>
        -Second 25% zombies will spawn and then you kill Oz.
        <br>
        -Third 25% same as second but the infected gas on the pillars will show up.
        <br>
        -Fourth and last 25% same as above but the lasers will show up.
        <br> <br>
        <div class="Underline">
        Defeating Oz
        </div>
        When you have successfully defeated Oz, a max ammo will drop and a DNA bomb will drop. Credit supply drops will start coming down. So grab them as fast as you can before An-G is done counting down from 10. When she is done counting you will teleport the same place you were before.
