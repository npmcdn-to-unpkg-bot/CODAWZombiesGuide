However, its major drawback is that its reserve ammo is relatively low, although the weapon still has its 3D Printer that allow the player to gain four rounds every five seconds; while the time needed to replenish a large amount of ammunition is long, the player may use another weapon while the IMR prints more ammunition.

            The MK14 is a generally effective weapon despite its price, but due to the playstyle of Exo Zombies, it may be better to trade it in for a better weapon when possible. Comparing it to the other wall weapon that can be bought from the start, the Bulldog, the MK14 has a much higher magazine and reserve ammo capacity and farther range, but lower damage and a slower reload. They are both effective in their own ways; it just depends on the player's playstyle.

A fully-upgraded SAC3 is very powerful, being able to easily clear hordes of zombies.

            Due to it being in one of the first room's available, relatively low price, good magazine size of 35, and burst fire configuration, the AMR9 is a great weapon for purchase in the early rounds to rack up points. Its burst configuration allows the AMR9 to be pretty powerful, able to get 1 burst kills for a good amount of rounds. As well, it reloads rather quickly, and has great movement speed, meaning the player is less likely to be overrun by Zombies.

            In terms of performance, it is often compared to the Ameli, due to their similar magazine capacities, and due to both being Light Machine Guns. The Ameli is generally better when damage is concerned, as the much healthier rate of fire will often prove to down zombies quicker than the Pytaek is capable of. However, the Pytaek has overall better ammo conservation and also has 25 more rounds per magazine, but has reduced reserve ammo. However, both of these weapons have ammo consumption concerns, which may force the use of another weapon and the need to get Full Reload or use the Upgrade Station to replenish the ammunition.

            The MAHEM is an extremely powerful weapon, being able to kill multiple zombies with ease. In addition, the splash damage is next to negligible, making it much safer to use compared to launchers from previous Zombies game modes.

It is recommended to use Exo Health and Exo Reload in conjunction with this weapon to counteract these weaknesses.

            The Crossbow is able to do high explosive damage, and may kill zombies with ease even after round 25. The Crossbow bolts don't explode on contact, which forces the player to either stick the bolts onto zombies for optimal effect. The advantages are that the Crossbow reloads quickly, and also doesn't slow down the player when running. Its ammo is rather high. </div>
        <br>
        <br>Exo Health comes as an optimal Exo Upgrade when using the Crossbow, to prevent the weapon's splash damage to damage the player too much when bolts are fired too close. Exo Reload can also be helpful, although the short reload time doesn't make it very necessary.

            <br>
            <br> The Distraction Drone is often thrown to allow the player(s) to reload, retrieve power-ups, or revive downed players. Drones are also replenished by a Full Reload power-up. Therefore, throwing one to retrieve one is not a waste. Another good strategy is to get close to the horde of zombies around the Drone and either throw grenades or fire powerful weapons, which will quickly kill all of the zombies. More points can be obtained if done with a bullet firing weapon, such as an Ameli or a Pytaek.
            <br>
            <br> A smart thing to do is if there is a Full Reload power-up is the player should waste their two Drones, because they will be replenished when the power-up is obtained. However, a Distraction Drone will not be given if one is being primed to throw. Alternatively, one is refilled at the beginning of each round if the player has less than the maximum amount of 2.
