            Exo Soldier allows the player to shoot and reload while sprinting and sliding. It also increases weapon swap speed and hip fire accuracy. Exo Soldier is particularly useful in higher rounds, as it allows the player to reload while sprinting, which is useful when being chased by a massive horde of zombies.
