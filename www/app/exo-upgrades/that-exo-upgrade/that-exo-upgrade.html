            Exo Soldier allows the player to shoot and reload while sprinting and sliding. It also increases weapon swap speed and hip fire accuracy. Exo Soldier is particularly useful in higher rounds, as it allows the player to reload while sprinting, which is useful when being chased by a massive horde of zombies.

            On Solo:
            <br>
             When the player is downed, they will be equipped with their handgun (Atlas 45 if the player doesn't have one) while they are down and will be revived shortly after. The zombies will move away from the player while they are being revived. It can be bought only three times before becoming unavailable for the rest of the game.
            If the player has a different pistol or the CEL-3 Cauterizer, they will use that when they are down.
