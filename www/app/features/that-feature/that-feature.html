            Upgrades are permanent, meaning one can get rid of an upgraded gun and then buy it again off the wall or from the 3D Printer but without needing to start over with all the upgrades. Players can upgrade their weapons a maximum of 19 times per weapon up to Mk20. A secret experimental Upgrade Station can be unlocked by completing a certain part in the easter which will allow players to upgrade one more time to Mk25. Each time the player upgrades the gun, it will replenish ammo, gain a new skin, and get increased stats. In specific Mk levels, a new attachment may be added or maximum ammunition may be increased.
