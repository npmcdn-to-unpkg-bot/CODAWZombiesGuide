            Little is known about Oz's life before working at the Atlas Corporation. What is known, is that Oz was formerly a soldier who participated in a war. While it is unknown whose side Oz fought for, the experience was mostly unpleasant for him. According to Captain Lennox, Oz was also previously a member of the Sentinel Task Force, up to the point when they witnessed the zombie infection begin in New Baghdad. He then supposedly left Sentinel, and went to work at an Atlas research facility, as a janitor, to avoid the complexity of his previous life. On one night, while performing his usual clean up duty, Oz spotted streaks of blood on the ground, along with several broken glass casings and some dead bodies. Afterwards, a zombie outbreak occured in the facility, forcing him to evacuate. He arrived at the helicopter landing pad along with three other Atlas employees, Lilith, Decker, and Kahn. The rescue Warbird was attacked by zombies and crashes down, forcing Oz and the others to team up to survive against the onslaught of zombies. In an attempt to escape, all four survivors retrieved a communication box from the Warbird, as well as their employee keycards, and used them to call in a second Warbird for extraction. However, as the Warbird approached the facility, it was shot down by an Atlas care package, leaving the four survivors stranded. They eventually made a last stand against the zombies, but were defeated. Atlas forces arrived and saved them in the nick of time, then transported them to a facility located near a Burger Town restaurant. Some times later, they recovered and found themselves in the midst of another zombie infection. Not only did they have to fend off the undead, but they also had to rescue civilians trapped in the vicinity of Burger Town. The four survivors eventually found a way to activate the Burger Town mascot, Bubby, which either came to life and aided them in battle, or just simply exploded. While doing this, they also unknowingly launched a missile. After doing this, they were stopped on the roof of the Burger Town restaurant and were taken captive by Sentinel forces. Their leader, Lennox, pointed a pistol at them and claimed one of the four must die. Oz is then executed in front of the other three, with Lennox justifying his actions due to Oz being the source of the infection. He then ordered his men to load Oz onto a chopper, while Decker, Kahn, and Lilith were then brought to an Atlas aircraft carrier out in the ocean. While being carried to the ship, Oz's body began to reanimate. While on the ship, Lennox and the Atlas employees discovered several diagrams depicting Oz as "Patient Zero", hinting at a possibility of Oz having been experimented on by Atlas Corporation before. They also found several data tablets, which contained the journal of the ship's former captain. When they inserted these tablets into the vault at the Gun Deck, the A.I. of the ship would then proceed to read them out in Oz's voice. After collecting all the tablets and discovering the story, the crew then decided to sink the ship to the bottom of the ocean. However, before they could be extracted in an emergency pod, they encountered Oz, having completely reanimated as a zombie. </div>

After sinking the ship, Lennox, Lilith, Decker and Kahn use the emergency pod and head to the Atlas underwater facility known as Trident Retreat, which Oz already infiltrated and took down the Atlas employees in it. After finally defeating Oz, Lilith uses a flamethrower to burn what remains of Oz. However, unbeknownst to Lennox and the others, there are thousands of pods that contain clones of Oz beneath the facility. One of the Oz clones is then seen opening his eyes. </div>

            Lilith works as an IT Specialist at the Atlas Biogenesis Research and Development Facility. One night, while working at her desk, she discovers several classified executive files. Upon successfully accessing the files, they display security footage of a zombie attacking an Atlas employee, and then lunging at the camera. Afterwards, an outbreak of zombies hordes the facility, forcing her to evacuate. She arrives at the helicopter landing pad along with three other Atlas employees, Oz, Decker, and Kahn.

In an attempt to escape, all four survivors retrieve their employee keycards, and use them to call in a second Warbird for extraction.

            Not much is known about Lennox before the zombie infection began. What is known is that he has been keeping track of four Atlas employees - Oz, Lilith Swann, Jim Decker and Kahn - for an unknown amount of time, possibly before their attempt to survive the outbreak at the Atlas research facility. When the four of them were brought back to an Atlas facility near a Burger Town restaurant, Lennox continued to monitor them, up to the point where they recovered and fought the undead forces in Burger Town. Lennox, going by the callsign Eagle One, sent out a message to the four survivors, asking them to hold out while he brings in a bigger chopper to evacuate them. He later requested them to help extract several civilians, who were trapped within the area. Each time, Lennox would arrive in a Warbird, extracting the civilian while providing assistance to the group. Eventually, he arrived in a Razorback VTOL, along with his Sentinel troops, and saved them from the last of the zombie horde, but held them at gunpoint. Upon meeting the survivors, he claimed that one of them "has to go". True to his words, Lennox then executed Oz in front of the other three, claiming that he was the source of the infection. He then had the other three injected with anesthetic, then transported them to an Atlas carrier ship. Once on board, he led Lilith, Kahn and Decker inside, where they found several diagrams depicting Oz as "Patient Zero", hinting at a possibility of Atlas Corporation having done experiments on him. After retrieving several data tablets containing the journals of the ship's captain, they then proceeded to sink the ship. However, before they could extract in an emergency pod, they encountered Oz, who had reanimated as a zombie. </div>
