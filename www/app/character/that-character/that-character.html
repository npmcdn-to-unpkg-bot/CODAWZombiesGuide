On one night, while performing his usual clean up duty, Oz spots streaks of blood on the ground, along with several broken glass casings and some dead bodies. Afterwards, a zombie outbreak occurs in the facility, forcing him to evacuate. He arrives at the helicopter landing pad along with three other Atlas employees, Lilith, Decker, and Kahn.

            He has been keeping track of four Atlas employees - Oz, Lilith Swann, Jim Decker and Kahn - for an unknown amount of time, possibly before their attempt to survive the outbreak at the Atlas research facility. When the four of them were brought back to an Atlas facility near a Burger Town restaurant, the Leader continued to monitor them, up to the point where they recovered and fought the undead forces in Burger Town. The Leader and his Sentinel troops then went in and saved them from a zombie horde, but held them at gunpoint. Upon meeting the survivors, he claimed that one of them "has to go".
