            <div class="step">
                Step 1: Acquiring the Black Box
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                The first step of the easter egg is to obtain the crashed warbird's black box. It can be found near the entrance to Exo Medic, behind the bus in the spawn area. To grab it, one must hold the action button near the back of the wrecked bus against the wall in a crevice between the wall and the crashed warbird.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 2: Placing the Black Box in the Computer
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                The next step is the bring the black box to a computer in the Morgue (D3) near the power switch for Exo Reload. However, after placing it, the players need to find and upgrade their security cards to gain access to the console.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 3: Getting Oz's Card
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                NOTE: Steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 can be done in any order.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br> Oz's card can be found in the room that contains holding cells resembling glass boxes in the ground in Holding (E1). One must obtain Exo Slam in order to complete this step. There are two glass cells near the area near Exo Health that can be found, where the second one must be slammed on. However, a small pipe under one (the one that has to be slammed on) must be shot out before doing so. The pipe is not the bars or shocks holding up the cell, but a pipe sticking up that doesn't connect to anything. The player(s) must shoot the bar until it completely disappears. After doing so, smash the second holding cell with Exo Slam and the third cell will come out of the ground. The card is located inside the cell on the floor. Grab the card with the action button before the cell goes back into ground. If the player fails to do so, they must re-slam the cell again. For co-op, all players must slam the cell at the same time for it to go down.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 4: Getting Kahn's Card
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                In order to obtain Kahn's card, the player will have to get infected first. Once infected, there are four keypads next to closed doors that look like little black boxes with green lights on the walls that have to be pressed using the action button while infected. The green light will turn blue when activated and they must be done consecutively and without using the decontamination. (In co-op, no players should use the decontamination while someone is turning the keypads on or else they will be reset. All players must also be infected and contribute for this step to work. If there is 2 players, both players must press 2 keypads. If there is 4, all players must press on one keypad.) They can be done in any order. The locations:
                <br>
                <br> 1. On the ledge only assessable with Exo Jump, to the right of the blocked door that zombies will spawn.
                <br>
                <br> 2. Near the trash chute, to the left is another blocked door.
                <br>
                <br> 3. A double door alongside the left of the Upgrade Station.
                <br>
                <br> 4. To the left of the Security Window, across Exo Medic.
                <br>
                <br> After that is done, Kahn's card can be found in the security window to the left of Exo Medic in the teller window slot. (when coming from the Decontamination Zone).
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 5: Getting Lilith's Card
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                To complete this step, one must obtain the EM1 from the 3D Printer. Once obtained, the player(s) must buy the 3D Printer once more. While the weapon is still printing, the player with the EM1 must fire at the weapon being printed. After buying it, Lilith's card can be found in the 3D Printer and can be grabbed from there.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 6: Getting Decker's Card
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                To get to the incinerator room seems to differ between solo and co-op play:
                <br>
                <br> Single Player: To access the incinerator room, the player must have unlocked the use of the trash chutes (by opening areas of the map), walk up to one of them and purchase the chute and immediately walk backwards away. Re-purchase the chute and move forward to go through it, the player will end up in the incinerator room.
                <br>
                <br> Co-Op: Once access to the chutes are unlock, have two players be on both chutes and enter in at the same time, this will put both into the incinerator room. The other players may enter as well using this method (looking up in the room, there are two chutes on the ceiling, thus making it possible to have others enter the room as the wall closes in.)
                <br>
                <br> Once in the room, the players must shoot at the ground on the right side of where the player spawns and press the "use" button repeatedly, as the card is buried underneath the trash (confirmed for single player). If the player shoots in the right spot they will see the card fly up and land on the ground. This step can be easily done if the player has a weapon with a Thermal Sight attached to it (eg. Ameli). The card will be highlighted when aiming down the Thermal Sight.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 7: Upgrading the Cards and Ending
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                In order to upgrade the cards, the player(s) must kill tons of zombies. Zombies will now drop key cards which are required to upgrade them. Once each card (or if solo, the card you have) is upgraded to level 49, return to the computer station with the black box, and the player will be told that they "have not checked in today." Each player will then have to find a handprint scanner to upgrade to level 50. (Solo players must go to their own character's scanner).
                <br>
                <br> The locations of the handprint scanners are:
                <br>
                <br> -Kahn - Across from the MP11 in Administration.
                <br>
                <br> -Decker - In the back stairwell that is along the same wall of the trash chute in the Exo Room.
                <br>
                <br> -Oz - On the wall next to a broken doorway, left of Exo Health in Holding.
                <br>
                <br> -Lilith - In the morgue, opposite to the entrance of the Exo Station.
                <br>
                <br> Once all keycards are upgraded, return to the Black Box station and insert your keycard into the console. After doing so, go to the exos and pick one up (although it'll say you have one if you picked one up). Now return outside and a Warbird can be seen hovering above the map. However, it will get shot down, ending the easter egg and unlocking the achievement. If one returns to the Exo Room and tries to pick up another exo, a secret Upgrade Station will come out of the wall. This one is unique because instead of being able to upgrade weapons to Mark 20, it upgrades them to Mark 25.

                *Note* Highly recommend 3 or 4 players beacuse its easyier to complete the easter egg.

                <br>
                <br>-Step 1 and 2 can be in any order.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 1: Retrieving the Golden Pan
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                In the initial spawn area, there is a golden frying pan lying on top of the ceiling, hanging by one of the metal bars. A player needs to jump up (Exosuit is required) and press the action button to acquire the frying pan in their inventory.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 2: Blood Sacrifice
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                In the sewers, there are four pipes with valves attached to them. The position of these valves randomize with each game. The players need to find all four and turn them (by pressing the action button in front of them). Once all four are turned, the characters will comment about the atmosphere getting colder. The waterfall in the sewers will now reveal a hidden room inside, with an altar in the middle.
                <br>
                <br>Place the golden frying pan in the altar. The altar will slowly sink into the ground. Players now need to kill zombies near the pan so that their blood flow into the altar. After a specific amount of zombies is killed, the altar will rise, and players can pick up the frying pan again.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 3: Cook a Burger for Bubby
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                Go to Burger Town, and find a stove, where the players can place the frying pan. The players now need to find four chunks of meat, placed across the map. The location of each chunk randomizes each game, but is limited to four major areas of the map: Burger Town, Atlas Command, Voltage and Sewers. Also, the meat chunks spawn one at a time, so the players must place each chunk in the pan before finding the next one. Once all four chunks are recovered and placed in the pan, the players need to "cook" the meat, using the Magnetron. When the meat is ready, one will hear a "ding", and smoke can be seen rising from the pan and the meat.
                <br>
                <br> After this, the players need to recover a burger bun, which can be randomly dropped by killing a zombie wearing Burger Town uniform at any given time. The burger will automatically be picked up once a player walks over it. Once picked up, the player needs to take the burger back to the pan, and press the action button to make the burger, then press it again to pick the burger up. The burger, however, is contaminated, so whoever picks the burger up will be infected, and must use the Decontamination Station.
                <br>
                <br>Finally, take the burger to Bubby, who will accept the burger. He will then give a thumbs up, and make a comment on needing his battery replaced.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 4: Replace Bubby's Battery
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                Go back to the Atlas Command area, and find a screen displaying a diagram of Bubby. Hold the action button in front of the screen, then head to the power station of the area. A battery can be picked up in the wall across the power station. There's a short time limit for picking up the battery, so the players have to move quickly. Next, go to Value Voltage, and find the gas station, and plug the battery into one of the gas pumps. The players need to protect the battery while it is being charged up. Should zombies get near it and attack, the battery will fall out, and the players need to reinsert it. If a Toxic round occurs in Value Voltage, the battery will also fall out.
                <br>
                <br>Players will be notified of the battery being fully charged when the gas pump station lights up. The battery can now be picked up again, and can be given to Bubby. Bubby will then hand over a white key, which can be picked up by any player.
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                Step 5: Retrieving the datapad and Activating Bubby
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                The player with the white key can now open up a hatch below the giant burger at the Burger Town entrance, which gives access to a small room inside the burger. There, the players can find an Upgrade Station, which upgrades the player's weapons to level 25. Also located within the burger is a computer screen, which will flash "Access Denied" when interacted.
                <br>
                <br>The players now need to go down into the sewers, and activate the Insta-Gator. When a Gator rises up and snatches a zombie, shoot the Gator to make it explode into pieces. The players can pick up a zombie hand from where the gator was. Now, the player with the zombie hand needs to go back to the spawn area, where they can find a hand scanner. Use the hand scanner with the zombie hand, and a panel on its side will open, revealing a red datapad.
                <br>
                <br>Take the datapad to the giant burger, and interact with the screen again. It will now display the Bubby diagram, and it will kick the player out. The giant burger will now shoot out "hamburger bombs", which can be picked up and thrown at zombies, similar to Uplink Drones. Afterwards, a countdown will display on screen. Once finished, the burger will shoot a missile into the air. Go back inside the burger and pick up the datapad, which will now display green.
                <br>
                <br>Bring the datapad to Bubby, and one of two outcomes will occur:
                <br>
                <br>-Bubby will simply explode, having been "set free," and will drop three random power-ups.
                <br>-Bubby's eyes will glow red, and he will then pick up the sign next to him. For the next round, Bubby will become an ally, and will fight the zombies alongside the player. Once the round finishes, Bubby will do a breakdance, then explode and drop three random power-up.
